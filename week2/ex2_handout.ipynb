O-ring failures had previously been observed on 6 of out the 23 prior launches as plotted below.\n",

The number of o-rings for all launches were $N = 6$, and hence, the fraction of failed o-rings for the $i$'th launch is $\\frac{y_i}{N_i} = \\frac{y_i}{N} = \\frac{y_i}{6}$.\n",

In contrast to the Beta-binomial model, the logistic regression model is **not a conjugate model**, which means we cannot compute the posterior distribution $p(\\alpha, \\beta|\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{x})$ analytically. Instead, we will use a very simple **grid approximation** $q(\\alpha, \\beta)$ to represent the posterior distribution:\n",

This is usually fast and easy to do, but the significant drawback is that it tends to produce **overconfident** predictions because it ignores the uncertainty for $\\theta^*$.
